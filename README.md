# Teleflix

Teleflix is an Android app that lets you stream movies, TV shows, and videos directly from Telegram channels and Cinemeta catalogs without downloading entire files first.

It runs a local HTTP streaming proxy powered by TDLib. When you play a video, the app fetches byte ranges on demand directly from Telegram's servers and pipes them to your player (ExoPlayer, VLC, MPV, MX Player, etc.).

## Features

- **Dual Catalogs**: Switch between Cinemeta (movies & series metadata) and your monitored Telegram channels.
- **On-Demand Range Streaming**: Start watching instantly. Skip forward or back without waiting for full downloads.
- **Split & Archive Streaming**: Merges multi-part files (`.zip.001`, `.part1.rar`) on the fly while streaming.
- **Custom Player Choice**: Select ExoPlayer, MPV, VLC, MX Player, or your system launcher. Keeps track of watch history and resume points.
- **Clean Dark Theme**: Dark AMOLED UI (`#0B0B0F`) with rounded cards and clear typography.
